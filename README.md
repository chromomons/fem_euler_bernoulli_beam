# FEM for Euler-Bernoulli beam equation
Repository of my math capstone project (2020).

These files present an implementation of the Finite Element method for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation of cantilever variation, which models the lateral deflection of a retaining wall subjected to a swelling pressure. 

To run the solver, clone this project, open it from terminal and execute ``python3 solver.py``.
